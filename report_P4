# P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive

## 1. Implement a basic driving agent

** In your report, mention what you see in the agent’s behavior. Does it eventually make it to the target location? **

The line action = random.choice([None, 'forward', 'left', 'right'])` makes the driver choose a random action. It makes its way through the world and to the location by chance. Usually it takes quite a lot of time until the location is reached.

## 2.  Identify and update state

** Justify why you picked these set of states, and how they model the agent and its environment.**

## 3. Implement Q-Learning

 ** What changes do you notice in the agent’s behavior? **

## 4. Enhance the driving agent

** Report what changes you made to your basic implementation of Q-Learning to achieve the final version of the agent. How well does it perform? **




** Does your agent get close to finding an optimal policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible time, and not incur any penalties? **
